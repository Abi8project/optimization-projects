## 📁 Project 1: Cost Minimization
**Goal:** Find the minimum of a cost function using calculus and numerical methods.  
**Tools Used:** NumPy, Matplotlib  
**Files Included:**  
- `main.py` – code for cost minimization  
- `output.png` – graph showing the cost curve and minimum  
- `project_description.pdf` – academic summary

## 📁 Project 2: Data Analysis Optimization
**Goal:** Fit a best-fit line (least squares regression) to a dataset.  
**Tools Used:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib  
**Files Included:**  
- `main.py` – code for linear regression  
- `output.png` – data trend and best-fit line  
- `project_description.pdf` – summary write-up
